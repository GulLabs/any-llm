# @gullabs/drizzle

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement the adoption backlog: add core reasoning resolution exports, pricing-source introspection
  and construction-time strict pricing, unpriced-cost warnings, queue-delay attribution on results and
  records, Drizzle `queue_delay_ms`, hardened quota deny/defer decisions, service-tier re-validation
  after Google provider-options merge, and deterministic testing support for rate-limiter wait time.

  Docs now cover ledger sidecar transaction composition, `metadata.operationId` correlation for
  grounded-to-structured workflows, multi-runtime retry caveats, and caller-owned structured-output
  validation.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ea4b941: Implement the integration-fixes API cleanup across structured output, ledger identity, Gemini Flex fallback, and API-verified Gemma 4 routing.

  Breaking API changes:

  - Replace Standard Schema/Zod output validation with forward-only `output.jsonSchema`. The library forwards the JSON Schema hint to providers, JSON-parses native structured output, surfaces `outputParsed`, and leaves business validation to callers.
  - Remove `InferOutput`, generic `LlmRequest`/`LlmResult` output typing, `output.schema`, `parse_error`, and `zodToGeminiSchema`.
  - Make `attemptId` the durable ledger identity. The drizzle schema now uses `attempt_id` as the primary key, removes the redundant UUID `id`, and adds `external_id`, `served_service_tier`, and `output_parsed`.
  - Add `idempotencyKey` and `externalId` request correlation fields. `idempotencyKey` is ledger idempotency only; provider calls are not deduplicated.
  - Add provider-builtin Gemini Flex fallback to standard tier on capacity pressure, with `servedServiceTier` returned and persisted so cost/retry logic uses the tier actually served.

  Gemini/Gemma routing changes:

  - Add API-verified Gemma 4 routing (`gemma-4-31b-it`, `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`) with thinking(level), grounding, native structured output, and vision.
  - Add `nativeStructuredOutput`, `serviceTiers`, `vision`, and `audioInput` capability flags with per-model service-tier gating.

  Only two Gemma 4 model IDs are confirmed callable via the live Google Gemini API. All previously listed IDs (e2b, e4b, 12b variants, google/ aliases) return HTTP 404 and are removed. Both verified models support native structured output (responseMimeType + responseSchema), grounding, vision, and thinkingLevel reasoning. thinkingBudget is rejected by the API with HTTP 400 and is not used.

  Gemma 4 reasoning effort is now constrained to `none`/`high` only (`low`/`medium` are rejected at validation time with a `bad_request` error). This reflects live API behaviour: the models only accept MINIMAL and HIGH `thinkingLevel` values; LOW and MEDIUM return HTTP 400.

  gemini-3.1-pro-preview now rejects effort: 'none' at validation time; the model has no MINIMAL thinking level (thinkingLevel MINIMAL returns HTTP 400).
