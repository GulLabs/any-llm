# @gullabs/quota

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement the adoption backlog: add core reasoning resolution exports, pricing-source introspection
  and construction-time strict pricing, unpriced-cost warnings, queue-delay attribution on results and
  records, Drizzle `queue_delay_ms`, hardened quota deny/defer decisions, service-tier re-validation
  after Google provider-options merge, and deterministic testing support for rate-limiter wait time.

  Docs now cover ledger sidecar transaction composition, `metadata.operationId` correlation for
  grounded-to-structured workflows, multi-runtime retry caveats, and caller-owned structured-output
  validation.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @gullabs/core@0.4.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the provider-quota companion package for any-llm with typed allow/defer/deny decisions,
  middleware and `RateLimiter` adapters, and an Upstash-compatible distributed store.
