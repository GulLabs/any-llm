# @gullabs/quota

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- dab0792: Fix bugs found in an independent adversarial audit of the adoption-backlog implementation:

  - `@gullabs/core`: `resolveReasoning()` no longer throws for positive sub-tier `budgetTokens` values on level-api models (only an explicit `0` budget is rejected as "none"); the engine no longer double-counts rate-limiter queue wait as provider-dispatch `latencyMs` when a call fails before dispatch ever starts (`latencyMs` is now `0` in that case, matching the documented `queueDelayMs`/`latencyMs` split).
  - `@gullabs/google`: add `normalizeGroundingCitations()` and the `Citation` type, a fail-open post-processing helper for deduplicating and normalizing Gemini grounding-chunk citations.
  - `@gullabs/quota`: reject non-integer/negative `rpm`/`rpd` quota-rule config with a deterministic `LlmError` (`kind: "bad_request"`, `retryable: false`) instead of a plain `Error` or silently disabling enforcement.

- Updated dependencies [dab0792]
  - @gullabs/core@0.4.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement the adoption backlog: add core reasoning resolution exports, pricing-source introspection
  and construction-time strict pricing, unpriced-cost warnings, queue-delay attribution on results and
  records, Drizzle `queue_delay_ms`, hardened quota deny/defer decisions, service-tier re-validation
  after Google provider-options merge, and deterministic testing support for rate-limiter wait time.

  Docs now cover ledger sidecar transaction composition, `metadata.operationId` correlation for
  grounded-to-structured workflows, multi-runtime retry caveats, and caller-owned structured-output
  validation.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @gullabs/core@0.4.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the provider-quota companion package for any-llm with typed allow/defer/deny decisions,
  middleware and `RateLimiter` adapters, and an Upstash-compatible distributed store.
