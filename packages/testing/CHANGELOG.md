# @gullabs/testing

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ba21620: Provider-qualified model identity — explicit `(provider, model)` everywhere (breaking, pre-1.0).

  - `LlmRequest`, `CallSite`, and `ResolvedRequest` now require a top-level `provider: string`; `model` stays the bare provider-native string forwarded verbatim to SDKs/CLIs. Bare requests without a provider, unregistered `(provider, model)` pairs, and slash-style `'provider/model'` strings are rejected with `bad_request`.
  - `ModelRegistry` is keyed by `(provider, model)`: `resolve(provider, model)`, `ModelDescriptor.id` renamed to `model`, duplicate exact pairs throw, the same bare model may exist under multiple providers with different config schemas, and prefix matching never crosses providers.
  - Routing is always by `req.provider`: the single-adapter bypass is removed, custom `route(provider, model, adapters)` results are checked against `adapter.id === req.provider`, and `createClient` verifies every registry descriptor's provider has a matching adapter.
  - Pricing composes per provider: `ClientConfig.pricing` is replaced by `pricingSources: Record<provider, PricingSource>`; the port shape is unchanged and `geminiPricingSource()` is the google-scoped source. A provider without a source yields an unpriced result with a warning.
  - Telemetry events carry `provider`; quota's `providerQuotaMiddleware` reads `req.provider` from the request (the `provider` option is removed).

### Patch Changes

- c1aa7ad: Open-source documentation pass: rewrote the root README and all package READMEs for
  accuracy and consistency, fixed stale content in DESIGN.md/SPEC.md/docs/architecture.md
  left over from the forward-only structured-output migration, restructured the root
  CHANGELOG.md to point at each package's own changelog, archived internal planning docs
  into `docs/archive/`, and scrubbed a private host name from a `@gullabs/core` source
  comment (no behavior change).

  `@gullabs/any-llm` also ships a new Agent Skill at `skills/any-llm/SKILL.md` teaching AI
  coding assistants (e.g. Claude Code) how to use this library correctly — per-call auth,
  the forward-only structured-output contract, error handling, and common mistakes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement the adoption backlog: add core reasoning resolution exports, pricing-source introspection
  and construction-time strict pricing, unpriced-cost warnings, queue-delay attribution on results and
  records, Drizzle `queue_delay_ms`, hardened quota deny/defer decisions, service-tier re-validation
  after Google provider-options merge, and deterministic testing support for rate-limiter wait time.

  Docs now cover ledger sidecar transaction composition, `metadata.operationId` correlation for
  grounded-to-structured workflows, multi-runtime retry caveats, and caller-owned structured-output
  validation.
